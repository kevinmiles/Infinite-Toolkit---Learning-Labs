# Step 5 - Check application behaviour

Now, it's time to check that our lab is working fine.

Default selection displays all items found.

If any error occurs because of request access or token management,
please refer to ITK lab 102.

'**TRAILERS**' category displays all 'TRAILERS' items found with a request to : **/contentInstances'**.

```json
REMARK:
The goal of the exercise is to implement a watchlist mechanism, so an 'Add to Watch List' button is added for each asset of the result list.
```

'**WATCHLIST**' category displays all 'WATCHLIST' items found with a simulated request.

```json
REMARK:
The goal of the exercise is to implement a watchlist mechanism, so a 'Del from List' button is added for each asset of the WATCHLIST category.
But the implementation has not been done yet. This can be easily achieve by using the 'local storage' capability of JavaScript framework.
You should be aware that each browser is managing its own 'local storage'.
```

Thanks a lot for achieving this learning lab.
