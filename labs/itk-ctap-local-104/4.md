#  Add your own API to existing Sandbox (4/5)


# Step 4 - Store Categories as new Sample Apps


## 4.1 Get the sources

The sources are available on following URL:
https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/Infinite-Toolkit---Learning-Labs

Perform following commands to install source code in a local workpace:
- git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/Infinite-Toolkit---Learning-Labs.git
- cd Infinite-Toolkit---Learning-Labs/labs/itk-ctap-local-104/assets/resources
- unzip **sample-apps.zip** to your local workspace
- run a local server using your local workspace as root:

  ![](/posts/files/itk-ctap-local-104/assets/images/Start-REF-API-104-03_xampp.jpg)<br/>

- select **httpd.conf** and search for Directory parameter, replace with your local workspace path:

```json
<Directory "C:/Users/myname/my_workspace">
```
</br>


## 4.2 Change the base URL 

At this stage, we need an sample application that is using our 'Hello World' server.
A small change in the **tokenManager/config.js** file is necessary in order to use the localhost as base URL:

```json
		"sandboxUrl": "https://apx.cisco.com/spvss/infinitehome/ivptoolkit/clientrefapi/sandbox_0.4.1",
```


should be modified by:
```json
		"sandboxUrl": "http://localhost:8090/ctap/r1.3.0",
```
</br>
