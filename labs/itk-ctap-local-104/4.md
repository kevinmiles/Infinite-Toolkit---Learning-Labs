</br>
> **Remark**: it's important to understand that in case of POST request, the query parameters are added to the body request:

When booking creation succeed, it returns a JSON answer which looks like the following:

```json

  "id": "BID_32525234",
  "bookingType": "event",
  "contentInstanceId": "CIID_234234",
  "recordingState": "notStarted",
  "recordingContentState": "empty",
  "targetDevices": [
    "cDVR"
  ],
  "created": "2015-10-05T14:30:00Z",
  "lastModified": "2015-10-10T08:11:00Z",
  "_links": {
    "plannerEvent": {
      "href": "/contentInstances/CIID_234234"
