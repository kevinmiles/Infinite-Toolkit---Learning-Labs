#  Add your own API to existing Sandbox (1/5)

## Step 1 - Overview

The **Infinite Toolkit** (ITK) sandbox is a cloud infrastructure allowing a client application to access consistent information about TV channels,  Video On Demand (VOD) assets and user settings.
The **REF API **is a set of commands provided by Infinite Toolkit (ITK) allowing a TV client application to access metadata and video content from **Infinite Video Platform** (IVP) head-end server about TV channels, Video On Demand (VOD) assets, manage records and modify user settings.
This API can be easily implemented for various framewok (HTML5, JavaSript, Angular JS, RDK, ...) and is multi-devices oriented for tablet, smartphone, laptop, set top box (STB).
