#  Add your own API to existing REF-API (1/6)

## Overview
The REF API is a set of commands provided by ITK allowing a TV client application to access metadata from IVP head-end server about TV channels, VOD assets, manage records and modify user settings.
This API can be easily implemented in various framewok (HTML5, JavaSript, Angular JS, RDK, ...) and target multi-devices (Tablet, smartphone, Laptop, STBs, ...).
