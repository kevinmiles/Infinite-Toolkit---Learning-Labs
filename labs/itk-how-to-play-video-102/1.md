#  How to play video content with REF-API (1/8)

# Step 1 - Overview

The **Infinite Toolkit** (ITK) sandbox is a cloud infrastructure allowing a client application to access consistent information about TV channels,  Video On Demand (VOD) assets and user settings.
The **REF API **is a set of commands provided by Infinite Toolkit (ITK) allowing a TV client application to access metadata and video content from **Infinite Video Platform** (IVP) head-end server about TV channels, Video On Demand (VOD) assets, manage records and modify user settings.
This API can be easily implemented for various framewok (HTML5, JavaSript, Angular JS, RDK, ...) and is multi-devices oriented for tablet, smartphone, laptop, set top box (STB).


> **Note**: The video content is usually provided at HLS format (*.m3u8)
> in order to adapt the bitrate on the bandwith avalaible at client side.
> More information about HLS standard here:
>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming
> (HLS = Http Live Streaming)

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to allow an ITK beginner to play a first video content using an HTML / JavaScript application.


Completion time: 45 minutes

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab it would be necessary to :

- [**Mandatory**] : Achieve first lab 'Start using ITK Sandbox and discover REF-API'
After achieving first lab, any sandbox user should now be able to use any API defined in REF-API.

- [**Mandatory**] : install a local server to test locally your application (APACHE, XAMPP, ...).
A local server is mandatory to perform authentication step based on URI redirection.
> Free servers can be found easily on Internet. Visit this link, for instance:

- [**Mandatory**] : REF-API specification,
> This API specification can be found here:
