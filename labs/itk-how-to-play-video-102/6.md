> 
> **Remark**: running the git clone in admin mode is necessary on Window to be able to create symbolic links. This issue isn't observed on Unix system or Mac.

The HLS  standard is supported by the **VideoJS** plugin used by our sample app.
> https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls
HLS main feature is to provide adaptive bit rate depending on connection bandwidth available at client side.

The video content starts playing in a dedicated almost fullscreen interface.
For current sandbox, video content is available at HLS format (HLS = Http Streaming)

Video controls, similar to those used on YouTube can be performed.
