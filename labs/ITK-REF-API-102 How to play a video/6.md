The HLS  standard is supported by the **VideoJS** plugin used by our sample app.
> https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls
HLS main feature is to provide adaptive bit rate depending on connection bandwidth available at client side.

The video content starts playing in a dedicated almost fullscreen interface.
For current sandbox, video content is available at HLS format (HLS = Http Streaming)

Video controls, similar to those used on YouTube can be performed.
