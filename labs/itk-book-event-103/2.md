Now, go to the **API Reference** section and find the **/agg/library/bookings** endpoint.
This endpoint is the one managing bookings.

In the  **/agg/library/bookings** section, user can use following modes:

- **GET** request on this endpoint lists all bookings.
- **POST** request on this endpoint creates a new booking.


Note that for an existing booking the  **/agg/library/bookings/{bookingId}** section provides following modes:

- **DELETE** request on /agg/library/bookings/{bookingId} will delete the specific booking.
- **GET** request on /agg/library/bookings/{bookingId} will return the status of the specific booking.
