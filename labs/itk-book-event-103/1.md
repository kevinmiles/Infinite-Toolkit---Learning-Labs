#  Book an event and manage records (1/8)

## Overview
The REF API is a set of commands provided by ITK allowing a TV client application to access metadata from IVP head-end server about TV channels, VOD assets, manage records and modify user settings.
This API can be easily implemented in various framewok (HTML5, JavaSript, Angular JS, RDK, ...) and target multi-devices (Tablet, smartphone, Laptop, STBs, ...).

> **Note**:
> a **booking** is a trigger associated to one single event (or a multiple episodes of a serie). When the timer fires at start time of the event, a video content starts to be recorded at server side by the CDVR feature.
> (CDVR = Cloud Digital Video Recorder)
> Once the video is **recorded** (or even when the record is in progress), the user can playback its video content.


# 1 Objective

The objective of this labs is to allow an ITK beginner to perform a booking associated to an event and to playback its video content using an **Angular JS 1.5** sample application.


Completion time: 60 minutes

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab it would be necessary to :

- [**Mandatory**] : Achieve first lab 'Start using ITK Sandbox and discover REF-API'
After achieving lab 101, any sandbox user should now be able to use any API defined in REF-API.

- [**Optional**] : Achieve second lab 'Play video content with REF-API'
After achieving lab 102, any sandbox user should now be able to manage play session t and watch video content via HTML5 application running on any browser.

- [**Mandatory**] : REF-API specification,
> This API specification can be found here:
> https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/apx/#/portals


- [**Mandatory**] : Angular 1.5 JS skill,
> To understand how the **Infinite EPG** application works with Angular JS some basic knowledge is necessary. Here is some useful link:
