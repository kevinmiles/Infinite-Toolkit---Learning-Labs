#  Start using ITK Sandbox and discover REF-API

## Overview
The ITK sandbox is a cloud infrastructure allowing a client application to access consistent information about TV channels, VOD assets and user settings.
The REF API is a set of commands provided by ITK allowing a TV application to access metadata about TV channels, VOD assets, manage records and modify user settings.

However, to be able to access these APIs, client application needs to authenticate.
All our APIs access are protected with your Cisco identifier credentials, using the OAuth 2 protocol.

> Important note: The authentication mechanism presented here is only for Infinite Toolkit Sandboxes. When the Infinite Video Platform is used in other contexts, accessing it may change.

## Objective

The objective of this labs is to allow an ITK beginner to perform his first request to the Infinite Toolkit sandbox using POSTMAN application.


Completion time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab it would be necessary to :

- [**Mandatory**] : install POSTMAN application allowing to perform REST API request.
In this module, we are going to use Postman application to make the REST API calls
An understanding of REST APIs would also be helpful.

- [**Mandatory**] : install a local server to test locally your application (APACHE, XAMPP, ...).
A local server is mandatory to perform authentication step based on URI redirection.
> Free servers can be found easily on Internet. Visit this link, for instance:

- [**Mandatory**] : get access to sandbox,
Procedure is described here, in Infinite Toolkit DevNet portal:
> https://developer.cisco.com/site/infinite-toolkit/

- [**Optional**] : REF-API specification,
> This API specification can be found here:
> https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/apx/#/portals
>

- [**Optional**] : if you are interested to understand better how OAuth2 authentication is working,
