#  Start using Infinite Toolkit (ITK) Sandbox and discover REF-API (1/5)

## Step 1 - Overview
The Infinite Toolkit (ITK) sandbox is a cloud infrastructure allowing a client application to access consistent information about TV channels,  Video On Demand (VOD) assets and user settings.
The REF API is a set of commands provided by ITK allowing a TV application to access metadata about TV channels, VOD assets, manage records and modify user settings.

However, to be able to access these APIs, client application needs to authenticate.
ITK APIs access are restricted to Cisco users.
Read **'get access to sandbox'** prerequisite below to have all information about that.

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to allow an ITK beginner to perform a first request to the Infinite Toolkit sandbox using POSTMAN application.


**Completion time**: 45 minutes

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab it would be necessary to :

- [**Mandatory**] : install POSTMAN application allowing to perform REST API request.
In this module, we are going to use Postman application to make the REST API calls
An understanding of REST APIs would also be helpful.
