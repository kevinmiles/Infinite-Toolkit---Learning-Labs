### Exercise #1: Get the channel list with POSTMAN application

Now that you have a Token, you are able to access to all REF-API.
Let try to use a simple API returning the channel list.
After installing Postman application, try to access the follwing URL:
https://apx.cisco.com/spvss/infinitehome/ivptoolkit/clientrefapi/sandbox_0.4.1/channels

You should get an **'access denied'** error.
It's normal, it's because you didn't add the token in the header yet !

  ![](/posts/files/itk-start-ref-api-101/assets/images/Start-REF-API-101-10.jpg)<br/><br/>

Edit the request header and add the following key / value:


Key | Value
------| ------------
"*Authorization*" | "*Bearer TOKEN_VALUE (1) *"
(1) where TOKEN_VALUE is replaced by the token value obtained at previous step
</br>





  ![](/posts/files/itk-start-ref-api-101/assets/images/Start-REF-API-101-20.jpg)<br/><br/>

Now you should get the answer in Body section of Postman.
```json
TIP:
Select "Pretty" to visualize the JSON answer nice formatted.
```


You can see that different information can be found in the answer:

- **count** attribute (number of channels returned to that request)
- **total** attribute (total number of channels available
- **channels[]**: an array of channels where each item has :


- - **id** attribute: a unique identifier for a channel
- - **name** attribute: the channel name to be displayed
- - **logicalChannelNumber** attribute: the channel number to be displayed
- - **media** attribute: array of ressources including channel logo for instance






  . . . and this is the end of Exercise #1 !

  Thanks for your attention.
