#  Get extended metadata with public API (1/5)

## Step 1 - Overview

The **Infinite Toolkit** (ITK) sandbox is a cloud infrastructure allowing a client application to access consistent information about TV channels,  Video On Demand (VOD) assets and user settings.
The **REF API ** is a set of commands provided by Infinite Toolkit (ITK) allowing a TV client application to access metadata and video content from **Infinite Video Platform** (IVP) head-end server about TV channels, Video On Demand (VOD) assets, manage records and modify user settings.
This API can be easily implemented for various framewok (HTML5, JavaSript, Angular JS, RDK, ...) and is multi-devices oriented for tablet, smartphone, laptop, set top box (STB).

# Step 1 - Objective

The objective of this lab is to allow an ITK beginner to use any public API to enhance EPG application with extended metadata. As an example, **MovieOrg** API is combined with existing sandbox REF-API. 
EPG application is an **Angular JS 1.5** application already described in Learning Labs 103.


**Completion time:** 60 minutes

## Prerequisites
Prior to starting this learning lab it would be necessary to :

- [**Mandatory**] : Achieve lab 'Book an event and manage records with ITK sandbox'
> After achieving lab 103, any sandbox user should be able to understand EPG application and to develop new EPG features.


- [**Mandatory**] : Angular 1.5 JS skill,
> To understand how the **Infinite EPG** application works with Angular JS some basic knowledge is necessary. Here is some useful link:
> https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ (Angular portal)
> https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/index (official tutorial)



- [**Optional**] : MovieOrg public API
> A detailed presentation of the MovieOrg public API is available here:
> https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
